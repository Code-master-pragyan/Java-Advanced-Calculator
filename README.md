*A modern scientific calculator built with Java Swing*

## ✨ Overview
The **Advanced Calculator** is a Java Swing-based scientific calculator with a sleek dark-themed UI. It supports standard arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, memory storage, and history tracking. The UI is designed with custom-styled rounded buttons and mimics the functionality of the ASUS laptop calculator.

## 🔥 Features
- 🧮 **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition ➕, Subtraction ➖, Multiplication ✖️, Division ➗
- 📐 **Scientific Functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, `sec`, `csc`, `log`, `sqrt`
- 🔢 **Power & Parentheses**: Supports exponentiation (`^`) and parentheses (`(, )`)
- 💾 **Memory Functions**: `M+` (Store value), `MR` (Recall value)
- 📜 **History Tracking**: Stores past calculations and displays them
- 🎨 **Dark-Themed UI**: Modern design with rounded buttons
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Support** *(Planned Feature)*
- 🎭 **Customizable Themes** *(Planned Feature)*
- 📈 **Graphing Capabilities** *(Planned Feature)*
- 📝 **Multi-Line Expression Input** *(Planned Feature)*
